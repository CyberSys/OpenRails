/* TRAINS
 * 
 * Contains code to represent a train as a list of TrainCars and to handle the physics of moving
 * the train through the Track Database.
 * 
 * A train has:
 *  - a list of TrainCars 
 *  - a front and back position in the TDB ( represented by TDBTravellers )
 *  - speed
 *  - MU signals that are relayed from player locomtive to other locomotives and cars such as:
 *      - direction
 *      - throttle percent
 *      - brake percent  ( TODO, this should be changed to brake pipe pressure )
 *      
 *  Individual TrainCars provide information on friction and motive force they are generating.
 *  This is consolidated by the train class into overall movement for the train.
