// This class is a copy of AIPathNode in AIPath.cs with additional methods.  But because of editing we cannot use subclassing
//  And changing AIPath.cs is a bit overdone, probably
//
// This class contains the definitions for nodes in a path.
// A path will be a (double) linked list of nodes, possibly with extra links for passing paths.
// The nodes are defined here. 
// They contain basic information like location and type, track index to next main/siding node.
// They contain a number of items related to drawing (like trackAngle, but some more for vectorNodes)
// They contain extra information to simplify editing (like HasSidingPath
//
// two types of nodes exist
//  junction nodes: those nodes that are on a junction. They contain junction Index as an extra field
//  vector nodes: Nodes not on a junction but somewhere on a vector node
//      either they are simple nodes needed for disambiguity
//      or they are special nodes like start, end, wait, uncouple, reverse nodes.
//      Vector nodes need more details on where exactly they are related to the track, and of course they need extra details
//          related to whatever special node they are.
//
// various constructors are available
//      related to whether the node is created from a .pat file, or created dynamically during edit operations.
// Because the path is a double linked list, to prevent issues with garbage collection, an Unlink method is provided that removes the lilnks.
