Version 108 Changes

WFile.cs
-- Added ability to read Dynamic Track world file objects instead of skipping over them. 
-- Added new Dynatrack class. Inherits from WorldObject.
-- Added TrackSections and TrackSection classes for reading dynamic track data. These actually belong in SBR.cs. Wayne will have to move them there and recompile Reader.dll.

Simulator.cs
-- Added public variables Season (SeasonType) and Weather (WeatherType).
-- Added ability to read information into the above variables by referencing data in the ACT file.

Weather.cs
-- New file. Added new class WeatherControl which sets overcast factor to match activity's weather.
-- This functionality is just the beginning. Eventually this class will handle dynamic weather.

- Viewer3D.cs
-- Added declaration and instantiation of the WeatherControl object.

Precipitation.cs
-- Added Reset functions to reinitialize the precipitation "drops" when the game clock is reset as in fast-forward -reverse calls.

Sky.cs
-- Added calls to the above precipitation Reset function when the user fast-forwards/reverses the time clock.

Shapes.cs
-- Changed value of draw sequence for primitives using translucent alpha to eliminate sprite alpha conflict.
