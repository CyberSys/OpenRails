Version 105 Changes

SceneryShader.fx
-- Added new global variable: overcast.
-- Removed hard coded coordinates for LightVector. It now tracks the sun position.
-- Added helper function to darken the scenery at night.
-- Added helper function to dim and reduce saturation of scenery in overcast conditions.
-- Added lines in each pixel shader to adjust color using the above two helper functions.
-- Deleted the sky pixel shader and its technique. Note that the technique "Dark" is now #3 instead of #4.

Shaders.cs
-- Added region blocks to show/hide each class.
-- Added parameter SunDirection to SceneryShader class, linked to SceneryShader.fx variable LightVector.
-- Added parameter Overcast to SceneryShader class, linked to new SceneryShader.fx variable overcast.
-- Added new SkyShader class.
-- Added new PrecipShader class.

Materials.cs
-- Added region blocks to show/hide each class.
-- Added SkyShader and SkyMaterial declarations and instantiations to Materials class.
-- Added new SkyMaterial class. 
-- Note that SkyMaterial makes three draw calls, for sky dome, clouds dome and moon, respectively.
-- Note that I obtained certain existing render states, changed them for the draw calls, then restored the originals. There may already be a more efficient way to do this somewhere in the parent classes.
-- Added helper function to darken fog at night and dim it as overcast increases.
-- Added new PrecipMaterial class.

Sky.cs
-- Completely re-written. Creates the geometry for the sky dome, the clouds dome and the moon quad.
-- Note that draw calls are directed to the appropriate starting point in the vertex and index lists using switch.
-- Note that temporary keyboard commands are used to rapid-cycle the time clock and cloud cover.
-- After trying spherical mapping of the dome, I ended up using top-down mapping again. This makes it possible to have a moving star field.
-- The dome vertex and index calcs are run twice, once for the sky dome and again for the clouds dome. Added input parameters to give the two domes unique properties. All vertices and indices for both domes and the moon (a simple quad) go into the same, respective, vertex and index lists.
-- Sun and moon position vectors are iteratively calculated and placed in two respective lookup tables at the beginning of an activity. Time interval is 20 minutes (72 iterations). Sun and moon positions are updated by interpolation.

SkyShader.fx
-- New file. Contains two vertex shaders, three pixel shaders and three techniques used for drawing the sky, the moon and clouds.

Precipitation.cs
-- New file. Creates an array of VertexPointSprites, a custom vertex format. Each vertex contains information about its position, size, spawn time and wind effect.
-- Vertex sprites are associated with small textures representing rain and snow.
-- Vertex sprites exist only in a relatively small block-shaped zone surrounding the camera.

PrecipShader.fx
-- New file. Sets the position of each vertex. Y position is determined by its age. Particle size is adjusted (reduced) proportional to its distance from the camera.

SunMoonPos.cs
-- New file. Contains calcs to determine the position vectors for the sun and moon at any given latitude, longitude, date and time.

WorldLatLon.cs
-- New file. Calculates the world latitude and longitude for a camera position on any given tile.
-- As of now this is only used to assemble the sun- and moon-position lookup tables.
-- Could be used in real time to display/update current lat/lon coordinates. Call ConvertWTC, inputting current tile EW and NS, X-Z position on the tile. Latitude and longitude, in radians, are returned by reference. See Sky.cs for an example call.

- Viewer3D.cs
-- Added lines to declare and instantiate PrecipDrawer and PrecipShader.
-- Added line in PrepareFrame( ) to enable PrecipDrawer to update itself. 

InfoDisplay.ccs
-- Adjusted time display to reset before/after midnight. This needs further tweaking if we want to display the correct time if the user rapid-cycles beyond the second day in either direction in time.

Launcher.csproj, Menu.csproj, RunActivity.csproj
-- Changed revision number to 105 (open the file in in Notepad and search for "Revision.txt")
